When we visit the doctor, drive our cars, get on an airplane, or shop for services, Data Science is changing the way we interact with and explore  our world.  Our world is now measured, mapped, and recorded in digital bits. Entire lives, from birth to death, are now catalogued in the digital realm. These data, originating from such diverse sources as connected vehicles, underwater microscopic cameras, and photos we post to social media, have propelled us into the greatest age of discovery humanity has ever known. It is through Data Science that we are unlocking the secrets hidden within these data. We are making discoveries that will forever change how we live and interact with the world around us. The impact of these changes is having a profound effect on humanity. We have propelled ourselves into this age of discovery through our incremental technological improvements.
